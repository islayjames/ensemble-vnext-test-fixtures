## Core Workflow

```
/init-project          --> Initialize project structure (once per project)
/create-prd            --> Product Requirements Document
/refine-prd            --> (optional) Iterate on PRD with feedback
/create-trd            --> Technical Requirements Document
/refine-trd            --> (optional) Iterate on TRD with feedback
/implement-trd         --> Execute implementation tasks
/fold-prompt           --> Optimize context for continued work
```

Always check for existing PRD/TRD before creating new ones.
